How to play:

Move with arrow keys.
Mouse1 is shoot.
Mouse2 places a proximity mine, which becomes active after X number of frames (gives you enough time to run away).
	Can/will be detonated via direct contact with any tanks, bullets, or explosions.
P is pause.

Bullets normally bounce off of walls once, exploding on contact with another wall.
	F5 makes all bullets bounce indefinitely.
	F6 returns it to one bounce.
	
For the coders:

You can do everything you need just within the ai method.
Unless you find a game-breaking issue, try not to edit anything outside of the ai method so that contributions can stay orderly.
